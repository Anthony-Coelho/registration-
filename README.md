This code was for a assignmnet in java 3 where we had to create a website that uses thymleaf to get user data and display it later in the program.

the controller used is found in registration-/demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/ 

the HTML pages are found in registration-/demo/src/main/resources/templates/ 

Note: for that term i challenged myself to try to be as creative as possible with styling each website i made, thats why this program looks the way it does when you boot it up.
