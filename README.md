Anthony Coelho: 
This code was for an assignment in java 3 where we had to create a website that uses thymleaf to get user data and display it later in the program.

The controller used is found in registration-/demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/ 

The HTML pages are found in registration-/demo/src/main/resources/templates/ 

Note: I challenged myself to try to be as creative as possible with styling each website i made in Java 3 and thats why this particular program may look a little odd when you boot it up.
